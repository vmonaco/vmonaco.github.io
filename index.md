I'm a researcher and engineer. My work and interests span security, privacy, machine learning, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and biologically-inspired computing.

Some of my open source projects include:

* [kloak](https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak), a privacy tool that obfuscates keystroke and mouse input event timings, making keystroke biometrics and device fingerprinting less effective.
* [frailtySurv](https://github.com/vmonaco/frailtySurv), an R package for simulating and fitting semiparametric shared frailty models.
* [pohmm](https://github.com/vmonaco/pohmm), a Python package that implements the partially observed hidden Markov model (POHMM).

I currently work on data privacy at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Previously, I was a Lead Data Scientist at [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/), Assistant Professor at the [Naval Postgraduate School](https://nps.edu/web/cs), and Computer Scientist at the [U.S. Army Research Laboratory](https://www.arl.army.mil/).
