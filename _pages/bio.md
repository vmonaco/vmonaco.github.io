I earned my B.S. (2012), M.S. (2013), and Ph.D. (2015) degrees in Computer Science from Pace University in New York. From 2011 to 2015, I was funded by the Department of Defense under the highly competitive Information Assurance Scholarship Program (IASP), a national full-ride scholarship awarded to approximately 20 students annually. During this time, I served as Chair for the One-handed Keystroke Biometric Identification Competition (co-located with ICB 2015), received the "Outstanding Student of the Year Award for Ph.D. in Computer Science", and was named one of Westchester's "Top Professionals Under 30" by Westchester Magazine. I've placed 1st in several data science competitions, including the Second Eye Movement Verification and Identification Competition (co-located with IJCB 2014) and the Keystroke Biometrics Ongoing Competition (co-located with BTAS 2016). I received Best Paper Awards at the 50th IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 2017, over 1k paper submissions) and the 2020 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2020, top 1% of submissions).
